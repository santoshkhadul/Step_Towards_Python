# 🚀 Python Arithmetic & Comparison Operations

Welcome to the **Python Arithmetic & Comparison Operations** script! This fun and simple Python program showcases a variety of basic arithmetic and comparison operations between two numbers, `a` and `b`. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced programmer, this code is a great way to understand how different operators work in Python. Let's dive into the world of numbers and operations! ✨

## 🔥 What Does This Script Do?

The script performs the following operations:

### 🔢 Arithmetic Operations:
- **Addition**: Adds the two numbers (`a` and `b`) together.
- **Subtraction**: Subtracts `b` from `a`.
- **Multiplication**: Multiplies the numbers (`a` and `b`).
- **Division**: Divides `a` by `b` and gives the result as a float.
- **Floor Division**: Divides `a` by `b` and returns the integer part of the result (ignores the decimal part).
- **Modulo**: Returns the remainder when `a` is divided by `b`.
- **Power**: Raises `a` to the power of `b` (exponentiation).

### 🤔 Comparison Operations:
- **Equal to (`==`)**: Checks if `a` is equal to `b`.
- **Not equal to (`!=`)**: Checks if `a` is not equal to `b`.
- **Greater than (`>`)**: Checks if `a` is greater than `b`.
- **Less than (`<`)**: Checks if `a` is less than `b`.
- **Greater than or equal to (`>=`)**: Checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `b`.
- **Less than or equal to (`<=`)**: Checks if `a` is less than or equal to `b`.

## 🧑‍💻 How to Use It?

1. Assign values to the variables `a` and `b`.
2. Run the script to get the output of the operations.
3. See the results of each operation printed to the console. ✨

## ⚡ Code Example:

```python
# Define numbers
a = 7
b = 2

# Addition
print('Sum: ', a + b)

# Subtraction
print('Subtraction: ', a - b)

# Multiplication
print('Multiplication: ', a * b)

# Division
print('Division: ', a / b)

# Floor Division
print('Floor Division: ', a // b)

# Modulo
print('Modulo: ', a % b)

# Power
print('Power: ', a ** b)

# Comparison Operators
print('a == b =', a == b)
print('a != b =', a != b)
print('a > b =', a > b)
print('a < b =', a < b)
print('a >= b =', a >= b)
print('a <= b =', a <= b)
